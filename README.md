# Availability-Aware Routing

This repository contains implementations and evaluation scripts related to  
**Availability-Aware Routing in the Presence of Geographically Correlated Failures**, INFOCOM

---

## Repository Structure

- `/test_data`  
  Input graphs and SRLG (Shared Risk Link Group) data.

- `/cpp_codes`  
  Black-box routing algorithms implemented in C++.

- `/results`  
  Output files generated by running the experiments.

- `/figures`  
  Plots and visualizations generated from the results.

- `measures.ipynb`  
  Notebook used to run experiments and generate raw results.

- `results.ipynb`  
  Notebook for analyzing results and creating figures.

- `my_utils.py`  
  Helper and utility functions used across notebooks.

---

## Dependencies

The following external Python packages are used for data processing, analysis, and visualization:

- `networkx` – graph representation and processing  
- `numpy` – numerical computations  
- `pandas` – result analysis and data handling  
- `plotly` – plotting and visualization  
- `dash` – interactive visualizations built on top of Plotly  

---

## Usage

### Compile C++ Codes

The C++ implementations in `/cpp_codes` can be compiled using `g++` as follows:

```bash
g++ dateline_capacity.cpp -o dateline_capacity -std=c++11
g++ dateline_prob.cpp -o dateline_prob -std=c++11
```

### Run Experiments

After compiling the C++ binaries, all experiments can be re-run using `measures.ipynb`.

⚠️ **Warning:**  
Running `measures.ipynb` will **overwrite the contents of the `/results` directory**.

### Analyze Results

To analyze existing results and generate figures, run the appropriate cells in `results.ipynb`.
